# Introduction

Welcome to the Temporary Framework documentation!


## What is the Temporary Framework?

Temporary is a [Go]() framework for building full-stack web applications using [Templ]() and [HTMX](). It tightly couples these technologies together and introduces other primitives to help you build web-applications easier and faster. Under the hood Temporary abstracts routing, building, serving and more. To better understand why Temporary was made, please read this [blog post]().


## Main Features

Some of the main Temporary features include:

- __Routing:__ A file-system based router built on top of Templ Components that supports indexing, nested routing, slugs and more.
- __Rendering:__ Dynamic and Static Rendering of Server Components. 
- __Data Fetching:__ Simple data fetching within Server Components with lazy loading using HTMX.
- __HTMX & Templ:__ Tightly coupled integration with HTMX & Templ extending both their functionality.
- __Go:__ The best language on Earth.


## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

Although the docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, you must have a basic understanding of Templ, HTMX, and Go. If you need to brush up on these skills, Google "how to get good".
