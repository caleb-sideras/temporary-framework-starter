<p>The skeleton of every application is routing. This page will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of routing for the web and how to handle routing in Temporary.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>First, you will see these terms being used throughout the documentation. Here's a quick reference:</p>
<p><code>IMAGE</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tree:</strong> A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure. For example, a component tree with parent and children components, a folder structure, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Subtree:</strong> Part of a tree, starting at a new root (first) and ending at the leaves (last).</li>
<li><strong>Root:</strong> The first node in a tree or subtree, such as a root layout.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf:</strong> Nodes in a subtree that have no children, such as the last segment in a URL path.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>IMAGE</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>URL Segment:</strong> Part of the URL path delimited by slashes.</li>
<li><strong>URL Path:</strong> Part of the URL that comes after the domain (composed of segments).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="roles-of-folders-and-files">Roles of Folders and Files</h2>
<p>Temporary uses a file-system based router where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Folders</strong> are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the root folder down to a final leaf folder that includes a page.go file. See <a href="">Defining Routes</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Files</strong> are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment. See <a href="">special files</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="route-segments">Route Segments</h2>
<p>Each folder in a route represents a route segment. Each route segment is mapped to a corresponding segment in a URL path.</p>
<p><code>IMAGE</code></p>
<h2 id="nested-routes">Nested Routes</h2>
<p>To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new <code>/dashboard/settings</code> route by nesting two new folders in the <code>app</code> directory.</p>
<p>The <code>/dashboard/settings</code> route is composed of three segments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/</code> (Root segment)</li>
<li><code>dashboard</code> (Segment)</li>
<li><code>settings</code> (Leaf segment)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-conventions">File Conventions</h2>
<p>Temporary provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>index</code>: Shared UI for a segment and its children</li>
<li><code>page</code>:	Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible</li>
<li><code>route</code>:	Server-side API endpoints that return HTML partials</li>
<li><code>handle</code>:	Server-side API endpoints</li>
<li><code>error</code>:	Error UI for a segment and its children</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="colocation">Colocation</h2>
<p>In addition to special files, you have the option to colocate your own files (e.g. components, styles, tests, etc) inside folders in the app directory.</p>
<p>This is because while folders define routes, only the contents returned by <code>page.go</code>, <code>route.go</code> and <code>handle.go</code> are publicly addressable.</p>
