<p>Welcome to the Temporary Framework documentation!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-temporary-framework">What is the Temporary Framework?</h2>
<p>Temporary is a <a href="">Go</a> framework for building full-stack web applications using <a href="">Templ</a> and <a href="">HTMX</a>. It tightly couples these technologies together and introduces other primitives to help you build web-applications easier and faster. Under the hood Temporary abstracts routing, building, serving and more. To better understand why Temporary was made, please read this <a href="">blog post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="main-features">Main Features</h2>
<p>Some of the main Temporary features include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Routing:</strong> A file-system based router built on top of Templ Components that supports indexing, nested routing, slugs and more.</li>
<li><strong>Rendering:</strong> Dynamic and Static Rendering of Server Components.</li>
<li><strong>Data Fetching:</strong> Simple data fetching within Server Components with lazy loading using HTMX.</li>
<li><strong>HTMX &amp; Templ:</strong> Tightly coupled integration with HTMX &amp; Templ extending both their functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Go:</strong> The best language on Earth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pre-requisite-knowledge">Pre-Requisite Knowledge</h2>
<p>Although the docs are designed to be beginner-friendly, you must have a basic understanding of Templ, HTMX, and Go. If you need to brush up on these skills, Google &quot;how to get good&quot;.</p>
