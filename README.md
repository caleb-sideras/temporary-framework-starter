# DOCS

- issue with example routes returning the whole page??
    - navigating between dynamic routes and regular routes throws off temporary

- issue with mobile navigation footer being hidden

1. DIFFCULT
- delete/create default files on BUILD - > html/css/js delete 
    - so we dont want to just delete all the files in this dir - simply because users might add shit to this?
    - store files we saved so we can remove them?
    - give a warning to the user about storing files here? 

- create code for the handlers instead of the definitions.go?
    - could still have the same process but the routes would be stored in separate package?

2. NORMAL
- Roadmap

- fix highlighting of focused color
- add transitions? not sure
